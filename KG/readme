Here are the codes for creating knowledge graph for the clinical features based on the co-occurrence matrix. One should first use pre.py to obtain the information of the raw dataset, including the number of patients, average numebr of features recoreded for each patients on each day, etc.. Then use the pre.R to obtain handle the co-occurrence matrix, including calculating the SVD-SPPMI matrix and other parameters needed to estimate the varaince of the estimated SVD-SPPMI matrix. After that, one can use cosine_test.py to estimate the variance. Finally, one can construc the knowledge graph with the code in onstruct_KG.R.
